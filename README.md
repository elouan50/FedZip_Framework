# Federated Learning

This project was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/malekijoo/FederatedLearning_Revision), with almost no README nor requirements provided.

It seems that it requires thses versions of librairies to run:
- tensorflow `2.6.0`
- tensorflow-federated `0.18.0`
- ...

which I was unable to fully install (even in a python virtual environment) because of deprecation of some sub-requirements.

In the end I couldn't make run this project, even by trying to update deprecated functions and methods (see branch).

Feel free to try yourself, I'll be working on related project until April 2025.
